// The only way the site goes live: `bun run deploy` (to SITE_URL, for now the workers.dev address). It deploys
// exactly what is on GitHub's main, and only after the quality gate has passed on it:
//   1. the working tree must be clean and HEAD pushed (on origin/main), so what is built is what was checked;
//   2. the address (SITE_URL, by default the game's own domain): the canonical, hreflang and preview links need it;
//   3. `bun scripts/check.ts`, all of it: types, tests, budgets, leaks, every scene as a desktop and a phone, the
//      time to playing, Lighthouse and pa11y, against the floors and perf/baseline.json;
//   4. the production build with SITE_URL, its size budgets again, and a look at what would be uploaded;
//   5. the upload with `bunx wrangler deploy` (wrangler.jsonc).
// Options:
//   (none)      the game without the recorded announcements (RECORDINGS=0 in vite.config.ts): they await the rights
//               holder's approval, so every call is spoken by the browser's voice and no clip of the Utrop library is
//               built or uploaded (the free recordings of people in audio/sfx/ are). The whole gate runs on that build.
//   --with-recordings   the game with them, once they are cleared.
//   --landing   the landing page alone, without the game (LANDING_ONLY=1 in vite.config.ts): the game, the network view,
//               the physics and every recording are neither built nor uploaded, and the page says the game opens
//               soon. The gate is the quick one and the landing page's audits, on that build.
//   --dry-run   everything but the upload.
// The Worker (worker/, wrangler.jsonc) goes up with every deploy: the hub behind /ghosts, /feeds, /notes, /perf, /errors and
// /perf. Its secrets are set once, apart: `bunx wrangler secret put TRAFIKLAB_RT_KEY` (and TRAFIKLAB_STATIC_KEY,
// NOTES_ADMIN_TOKEN); see docs/DRIFT.md.
// Agents may not deploy any other way: a Claude Code hook blocks deploy commands run directly (scripts/hooks).
