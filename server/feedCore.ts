// The shared cache of the open data feeds, served at /feeds/<name>: by the Bun relay in development (server/feeds.ts,
// which adds GTFS Regional when it has Trafiklab's keys) and by the hub on Cloudflare (worker/hub.ts). Nothing here
// needs Bun or a browser.
// Every player asks the relay, the relay asks the source at most once per feed's interval, and only while someone is
// asking: with nobody playing it makes no requests at all. Concurrent requests share one upstream fetch, a failed
// fetch is not retried for a while, and a usable last copy answers at once while the next is fetched.
//
// Every answer is { at, data }, `at` being when the relay fetched it (epoch ms):
//   GET /feeds/sl          data: { [site]: { departures } }   SL departures at every metro station from GTFS Regional
//                          with Trafiklab keys (server/gtfs.ts), else at the blue line's from SL's Transport API
//                          (also when GTFS has failed for longer than its last copy keeps)
//   GET /feeds/deviations  data: SL's traffic information, as SL sends it
//   GET /feeds/weather     data: Open-Meteo's answer, as it sends it
//   GET /feeds/warnings    data: SMHI's warnings for Västra Götalands län only
//   GET /feeds/news        data: [{ title, published }]   P4 Göteborg's news, for the newspapers
